# Analysing data in RStudio. 

Now that we have our RStudio set up, we need to upload our data. Data can be moved into the cluster using [Globus](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus/en) or through JupyterHub in your browser. Alternatively, you can upload data into the cluster using `scp` (secure copy protocol), as we'll do here. 

The `scp` command follows the structure `scp <file start location> <file end location>` whether you are moving data on to the remote server from your computer, or from the remote server on to your computer. When the file location is on the remote server, it must start with `<username>@<remote server address>:` and then the file location on the server. 

You should already have the [nlsc_data.csv](./content/nlsc_data.csv) downloaded. My downloaded data is in my downloads folder, at the file path `./Downloads/nlsc_data.csv`. I plan to save it in my home directory on the cluster (which should have been created when we launched the RStudio session in our browser). So, to move the data, run the following command (replacing the file paths as appropriate): 

```shell
scp "./Downloads/nlsc_data.csv" finnsdot94@feb2026-uofa.c3.ca:~/
```
The terminal will then prompt you to enter your password for the cluster. Once you've done that, you should see a printout of your file transfer progress.

Once that is complete, you can navigate back to your RStudio session in your browser. Your data should now be visible in the `Files` tab in the lower right-hand pane.  

???note "About the data."

    In this workshop, we're using data from the [National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, 1966-1990](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/older-and-young-men). You can download it [here](./content/nlsc_data.csv). Specifically, we'll be working with the following variables: 

    - ID
    - Age
    - Race
    - Marital status
    - Urban/rural residence
    - Highest grade attained
    - Housing 
    - Family income
    - Children

    Here is a [codebook](./content/codebook.xlsx) of the data excerpt we're using.

    Citation: Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, 1966-1990 (rounds 1-13). Produced and distributed by the Center for Human Resource Research (CHRR), The Ohio State University. Columbus, OH: 1999.

Using this data, we're going to investigate the age-old relationship between education and income. To do this, we're going to run a linear regression of income on education, controlling for various sociodemographic factors. But first, we need to set up our working environment. Once in RStudio, start by setting your working directory to be the `R` folder, and by creating output folders for your data and figures. 

```R
getwd()
setwd('R')
getwd()

#setting up folders
dir.create('data_output')
dir.create('fig_output')
dir.create('table_output')
```

If not all your new folders show up when you run the lines, try refreshing the `Files` pane. 

We'll save our model output, modified data, and plots in these folders. Next, load the libraries we'll be using. Unlike with the `install.packages ` function, we cannot feed libraries in as a list. 

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
library(ggplot2)
library(stats)
library(coefplot)
library(broom)
```

After loading the various libraries we'll use, load in your data as "data" and inspect it. Since our data is in home directory, and we are working in the R folder, you'll need to start your file path with `..` to represent the directory above. 

One option for inspecting our data is to use the `str()` function, which will return informaiton on the structure of the data frame, as well as on the class, length, and content of each column (variable). You can also call `head()` and `tail()` to look at the first and last six rows of the data frame. 

```R
data <- read.csv("../nlsc_data.csv")
str(data)
head(data)
```

Next, call `view(data)` and scroll through the data window that pops up. You should see that our data includes some values that don't make sense, such as income values of -2 and -4. This is because missing values are being represented as -2 and -4 in our dataset. Before we do any more analyses, we'll need to replace those with `NA` values. To do this, we will use functions from the `naniar` package. First, let's replace the missing values in the income variable. 

```R
data2 <- data %>% replace_with_na(replace = list(income = c(-2,-4)))
```

In the code above, we supply arguments to the `replace_with_na` function that specify the variable to be edited and the values to be replaced. We then pipe that function into the data frame, and assign it to a new data frame (to preserve the original data).

The `naniar` package also has a function that allows us to replace a particular value with `NA` across an entire data frame:

```R
data2 <- data2 %>% replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x == -4)
```

In this code, we use the function `replace_with_na_all` and supply it with the conditional argument replacing any variable (represented by ~.x) value of -4 with `NA`. We then pipe it into the same modified data frame. 

Next, let's make a scatterplot from our cleaned data to visually assess the relationship between education and income using `ggplot`. Let's also save it to our fig_output folder. 

```R
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=highest_grade, y=income))+geom_point()

ggsave("./fig_output/educ_inc_plot.png")
```
The resulting scatterplot shows us that there is a clear, positive relationship between total family income and educational attainment.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![scatterplot](./content/educ_inc_plot.png){width=600}
    <figcaption>Scatterplot of income by education.</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's further test this relationship by looking at the correlation between these two variables. We can do this using the `cor()` function and supplying it with arguments for our `x` and `y` variables. Given that we have missing data in our data frame, we will also need to tell it to use only complete observations, otherwise the function will return a value of `NA`. Remember that you can also go to the "Help" tab in RStudio to learn more about individual packages or functions. 

```R
cor(data$income, data$highest_grade, use='complete.obs') 
```

This function returns a correlation of 0.380902, indicating a moderate positive relationship between education and income - just as we saw in the scatterplot. 

Taking this another step further, let's now run a linear regression of income on education to test the statistical significant of the relationship. We do this with the `lm()` function in the `stats` package. The basic structure of a linear regression in R is `model <- lm(x ~ y, data=data)`. 

```R
model.1 <- lm(income ~ highest_grade, data=data)
summary(model.1)
```

What do the results tell us about the relationship between income and education? 

Obviously, the relationship between these things is more complicated. So, let's try adding some control variables to see how race, age, rural residence, and marital status might influence the effect of education on income. Before we do that, we'll need to recode some of our categorical variables into dummy variables. We can do this using the `mutate` function in `dplyr`, which allows us to preserve the original data. First, let's recode race and marital status into dummies for white and married:

```R
data <- data %>%
  mutate(white = recode(race,
                        1==1,
                        2==0,
                        3==0))

data <- data %>%
  mutate(married = recode(marital,
                          1==1,
                          2==1,
                          3==0,
                          4==0,
                          5==0, 
                          6==0))
```

As shown above, `mutate` can be combined with a `recode` function to recode the values of a variable one by one. However, this can be a bit cumbersome when dealing with a variable with multiple possible values. In these cases, `case_when` comes quite in handy. Let's now use `case_when` to recode residence and children. In this case, we'll recode them to test whether rural residence and having a large family impact the relationship between education and income.

```R
data <- data %>%
  mutate(rural = case_when(
    residence == 8 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0))

nlsc_data <- nlsc_data %>%
  mutate(child5 = case_when(
    children >= 5 ~ 1,
    TRUE ~ 0))
```

Now, we can put these into our model. We can build on the basic linear model structure in R by adding control variables behind the independent variable.

```R 
model.2 <- lm(income ~ highest_grade + age + married + white + rural + child5, data=data)
summary(model.2)
```

What does this regression tell us about the sociodemographic factors influencing the effect of education on income? 

Unfortunately, the way R naturally displays regression output is quite messy. We can produce a much nicer output using the `tidy` function from the `broom` package. Let's call `tidy` on our second model, and then save that output as a csv file to our data output folder.

```R
tidy_model <- tidy(model.2)
tidy_model

write.csv(tidy_model, "./table_output/tidy_lm_model.csv")
```

Let's plot out the coefficients now, using the `coefplot` package. We can save this plot using the 'Export' tool under the Plots tab in RStudio. 

```R
coefplot(model.2, intercept=FALSE)
```
Let's now save our modified data, and our R script. You can save your script in the browser window, and run the following to save your data:

```R
write.csv(data, "./data_output/modified_nlsc_data.csv")
```

# Analysing data in RStudio. 

Now that we have our RStudio set up, we need to upload our data. Data can be moved into the cluster using [Globus](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Globus/en) or through JupyterHub, as we'll do here. 

!!!note "About the data."

    In this workshop, we're using data from the [National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, 1966-1990](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/older-and-young-men). You can download it [here](./content/nlsc_data.csv). Specifically, we'll be working with the following variables: 

    - ID
    - Age
    - Race
    - Marital status
    - Urban/rural residence
    - Highest grade attained
    - Housing 
    - Family income
    - Children

    Here is a [codebook](./content/codebook.xlsx) of the data excerpt we're using.

# Using R and RStudio with HPC

Welcome to this workshop on using R and RStudio on the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's high-performance computing clusters. Over the course of this workshop, we will log into a cluster, load R and download some packages, and then use RStudio to do some model testing and visualization. Afterwards, we will submit our full script as a batch job to the cluster. 

This session is suitable for those with some R experience, who feel comfortable with writing and running R scripts. No prior knowledge of Linux or high-performance computing is required. While the examples and data used will be aimed at the Humanities and Social Sciences community, the session is open to anyone and everyone interested in learning about R.

## Learning outcomes 

1. Learn to use access the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's HPC clusters
2. Learn to navigate the cluster in your terminal
3. Learn to load R in the terminal, and to access RStudio through JupyterHub
4. Learn to submit a job to the cluster

## Before we start

We will be using a subset of data from the [National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, 1966-1990](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/older-and-young-men). You can download it [here](./content/nlsc_data.csv). 

I'd encourage you to follow along in R and RStudio, but if you get stuck or want to check something, you can download my [RStudio script](./content/rstudio_script.R) and my [R script for the shell]().
